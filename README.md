# Nonogram
Nonogram game version.

The game supports user profiles for players and five difficulty levels, with each level having 2 examples. Users can create an account with a username. Each account stores the user's data, including level progress. After logging in, the user can choose to play directly as far as they have reached or select from the level menu if they have passed level 1.

Once the user clears the current highest level, the next one is unlocked.

The game works by entering coordinates, which are the coordinates of a filled square. If the user makes a mistake, their lives are reduced. A total of 3 lives per user are also saved in the user's file. When the user runs out of lives, the game ends.

When the player passes all five levels, he is the winner!
